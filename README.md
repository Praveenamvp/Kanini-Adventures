# Kanini-Adventures

The "Kanini-Adventures" is a comprehensive full-stack application that enables travelers, travel agents, and administrators to seamlessly engage with the world of travel and tourism. Powered by a C# backend, a ReactJS frontend, and an SQL database, the platform offers distinct features based on user roles. Travelers can explore and book tour packages tailored to their preferences. Registered agents, after receiving administrator approval, can contribute by adding new tour packages to the platform. Administrators manage the entire ecosystem, overseeing user registrations, tour package additions, and bookings. This project embodies role-based authentication, intuitive user interfaces, and efficient API endpoints, making it a user-friendly solution for the tourism industry.
